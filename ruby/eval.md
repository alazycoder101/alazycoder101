`class_eval` and `class_exec` are both powerful Ruby methods used to evaluate code within the context of a class or module. However, they serve slightly different purposes and which one is "better" depends on what you're trying to achieve. Here's a breakdown of both:

### `class_eval`
- `class_eval` is used to evaluate a string containing Ruby code within the context of the class or module.
- It's often used when you need to define methods, constants, or class variables dynamically.
- Since `class_eval` takes a string as its argument, it's more flexible for cases where you're interpolating code or generating code on the fly.
- Example:
  ```ruby
  MyClass.class_eval "def new_method; 'Hello World'; end"
  ```

### `class_exec`
- `class_exec` is used to execute a block of code within the context of the class or module.
- It's useful when you want to pass arguments to the block or when the code to be executed is not easily represented as a string.
- `class_exec` can take zero or more arguments that will be passed to the block as local variables.
- Example:
  ```ruby
  MyClass.class_exec(:arg1, :arg2) do |a, b|
    def new_method_with_args
      "#{a} and #{b}"
    end
  end
  ```

### Choosing Between `class_eval` and `class_exec`
- **Use `class_eval`** when:
  - You need to define methods, constants, or class variables based on a string or when the code is generated dynamically.
  - You don't need to pass arguments to the evaluation context.

- **Use `class_exec`** when:
  - You want to pass arguments to the block of code being executed within the class or module's context.
  - The code is complex or cannot be easily expressed as a string.

- **Readability**: `class_exec` can be more readable when the code block is complex or when passing multiple arguments.

- **Performance**: Generally, `class_eval` might be slightly faster when dealing with strings, while `class_exec` is designed for blocks and may have some overhead for argument passing.

In summary, neither is inherently "better" than the other; it's about choosing the right tool for the job based on your specific requirements. If you're working with strings of code, `class_eval` is likely what you want. If you're executing blocks with arguments, `class_exec` is more appropriate.
